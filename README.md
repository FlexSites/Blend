# Blend
## An Elevated Billing Application for ingesting Google Drive Spreadsheets

#### Development
To develop, move to the `resources/app` folder. Run the following commands:
    npm install -g electron-prebuilt
    npm install
    electron .
We install electron-prebuilt in order to have the electron dev envionment globally and to run the electron application. We then run npm install to install our dependencies. `electron .` runs the application.

Within the application you can view the developer tools and console from the Electron menu.
